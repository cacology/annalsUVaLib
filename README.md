# Annals of the University of Virginia Libraries

The *Annals of English Literature 1475--1950* provide an elegant, yet
brief, overview of not only the major works of English literature, but
also the intellectual milieu from which they emerged.  Inspired by a
fantasy of Sir Walter Raleigh, the chronological compilation aims:

    to give the student, at a glance, the main literary output of any
    year or series of years; to show what books people were likely to
    be reading at any time, and with what rivals a candidate for
    literary fame had to reckon.  Though the main object is to
    discover any book in its chronological setting, and so to serve
    the ends of a work of reference, it has been found in practice
    that these brief annals can be read continuously with profit,
    and even with pleasure." (v)

Along with books, the *Annals* include events and intellectual
accomplishments that interest the literary student.  Being
"read continuously with profit" understates the value of reading this
work which can uncover themes, motifs and--even--zeitgeists in the
production of English literature.

This project to produce Annals for the University of Virginia
Libraries builds on the observation that a well-ordered chronology
provides the primary evidence of the collective thought of an
organization.  Decisions are made in the day-to-day activities of
libraries that aim at greater truths and higher goods; charting these
decisions illuminates the human thinking that went into them and the
problems that they might have had to solve.

## Method

Refusing premature optimization, the project began with a sketch of
a final form based on the *Annals* and also Neville Williams
*Chronology of the Expanding World: 1492 to 1762*:

Based on this sketch, I began an org-mode text-file of the major
events, tagging items without pattern and doing minimal secondary
research to find exact dates.  In time, I will convert this to a more
optimized form, but want to proceed in this loose fashion to see what
patterns emerge first.  For progress,
see [annalsNotes.org](annalsNotes.org) which uses the org-ref module
to link to a [bibliography of sources](sources.bib).
